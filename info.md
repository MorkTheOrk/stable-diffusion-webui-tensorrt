# TensorRT

You can use this extension to export optimized TensorRT models for best performance on NVIDIA RTX GPUs. This process has to be done once for every model
atchitecture you want to use. Applying LoRA weight can be done just-in-time.

**Please Note** that this process can take between 3-5 minutes. Ideally the GPU should not be stressed during that process as it might
result in suboptimal engine generation.
